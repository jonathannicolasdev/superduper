Rewinds is a Remix Tailwind Stack with Tailwind CSS family of libraries, interactive components, and the TypeScript ecosystem. The core stack as listed on the badges, includes: TypeScript, Remix & Remix Auth, React, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Radix UI, Prisma ORM, PlanetScale, and Vercel.

Check out the code and the demo:

- [rewinds.vercel.app](https://rewinds.vercel.app)
- [rewinds.dev](https://rewinds.dev) (Soon)

As for now, this README is the only main documentation.

## Some Details

Compared to the [the older `rewinds`](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif/rewinds-legacy), this newer version uses [`shadcn/ui`](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) as the base components style and setup for full stack app development is inspired by [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg). The main adaptation reason is that this repo uses Remix, not Next.js as the full stack framework.

This repo is kind of over-engineered to have high flexibility and cover a lot of use cases for different applications/projects/products. Currently includes the Remix HMR & HDR setup with both Vercel config and Express server on development as per Remix `v1.14`. The config is just combining the templates from Remix with Express and Vercel based on the environment.

## Some Background

Why creating this? Well, because I had a lot of recent projects with these same stack.

# Development

## Install Dependencies

Before running your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed using your preferred package manager agent:

```sh
npm i
yarn i
pnpm i
```

Or if using [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) which can autodetect the agent:

```sh
pnpm add -g @antfu/ni  # install once
ni                     # can auto choose npm/yarn/pnpm
```

## Setup Environment Variables

Use plain `.env` file for local development:

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
# `-i` or `--interactive` will prompt before overwrite
# then edit `.env` as you prefer
```

Or use [Doppler](htts://doppler.com) CLI to manage them:

```sh
doppler secrets download --no-file --format env > .env
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to setup the environment variables here, on Vercel, or on your preferred deployment target. Otherwise the app will break on production. That's why Doppler is recommended and there are some preset strings in the `.env.example` which you can copy directly.

## Run Development Server

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
nr dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.

# Deployment

## Vercel

As this repo was made after having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
ni -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

# Notes

## Workaround Explanation

To enable HMR and HDR, at least as per v1.14, we have to do this when not primarily using Express server.

If using pnpm, you also have to install `react-refresh` to resolve the HMR dependency:

```sh
ni -D react-refresh
```

When running locally in development mode, use either the Express server or Vercel. This by default does not understand the Vercel lambda module format, so we fallback to the standard build output.

```js
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

module.exports = {
  ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
  server: isDevelopment ? undefined : "./server-vercel.js",
  serverBuildPath: isDevelopment ? "build/index.js" : "api/index.js",
  appDirectory: "app",
  assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
  publicPath: "/build/",

  future: {
    unstable_dev: true,
    unstable_tailwind: true,
  },
};
```
